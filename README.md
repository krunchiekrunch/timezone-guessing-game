# Guess the timezone of a city

I got this idea from Random Idea Generator made by [@barxilly](https://github.com/barxilly/random-idea-generator)

This game is written in only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How to play

You can clone the repo and open the `Ã¬ndex.html` file in your browser to play it locally

or you can play the demo linked below.
